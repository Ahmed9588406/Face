# Face_ID
I built  a deep facial recognition application to authenticate into an application. Using Deep Learning with Tensorflow which replicates what is shown in the paper titled Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition. Once that's all trained i was able to integrate it into a Kivy app and actually authenticate!
I showed every thing in the code 
I attached the paper that i worked with to implement this project
